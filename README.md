## Clustering 2013 elections results
Unsupervised approch on the results of the 2013 elections , per ballot box, and some data from our national bureau of statistics on municipal areas in Israel.

I've construct an clustering model of ballot boxes by vote distribution and detected anomalous ballot boxes. I used religious and geographic
attributes of municipalities to cnstruct and evaluate a predictive model for vote distribution that explain results for selected parties.
